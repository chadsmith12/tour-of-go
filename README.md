# Tour of Go

This repository holds my notes and some example programs while following the Tour of Go guide from go.dev. This tour can be found at the following location [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour).

This repository is broken up into the following sections
* [Notes](./notes) - This holds all my notse taken while going through the tour. A lot of it will be copied from the tour as it helps me remember this way.
* [Examples](./examples) - This holds all the example programs that you can run. Most of the exercises that were more advanced are solved here. Some things from the very beginning were not solved because I found it a basic programming concept from other languages that I quickly grasped.

### Running Examples

To run an example is easy. Just `cd` into the `examples` directory and then just use go run. Example, lets say you wanted to run the [rot13Reader](./examples/rot13Reader/) example, it would be ran this way.

```cmd
go run rot13Reader/main.go
```
